-This is just a basic node application using inquirer, and mysql

-In this application you are able to go in as different user situatios "Customer", "Manager", "Supervisor"

-Depending on what you pick it will give you certain options on what you can do.

-Both Manager and Supervisor will require a password input which will be "0000".

-I had issues displaying an alias row that was no originally set up in the sql. I will need to either implement it in with a function or keep finding a way to build an alias row with the function inside it.

-I have also provided in here some query for mysql so that you can make the tables and text the functionality of this.

-Of course make sure to alter your connection settings accordingly.
